# Rename MMB Darwin Payslips

## Description  
This document renaming script allows was used by me to rename MMB Darwin Payslips back in 2020.  The downloadable PDF payslips all had a generic document name.  This script opens the PDF document, searches for the date details and renames the file appropriately.  If the payslip relates to a bonus, the document is renamed to include this in the file name description.  

## Usage
1) Copy payslips to 'data' folder
2) Run scripts
3) Payslips will be renamed to include the issue date
